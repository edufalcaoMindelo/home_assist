############# SENSOR GROUPS ########################
# Sensors in this group tigger the alarm immediately
immediate:
  - binary_sensor.im_cozinha
  - binary_sensor.im_suite
  - binary_sensor.im_sala

# Sensors in this group start the clock (pending_time) when tripped before the alarm is activated in 'Away' mode
delayed:
  - binary_sensor.im_entrada

# Same as notathome but hopefully the title is more self explanatory. Can still use notathome for backwards compatibility
# Note sensors can exist in more than one group notice top_floor appears in two groups
homemodeignore:
  - binary_sensor.im_suite
  - binary_sensor.im_sala
  
# notathome:
  # - binary_sensor.im_suite
  # - binary_sensor.im_sala
# Use this group to automatically override the warning message on open sensors when setting 'away' mode. (I use this as I have a motion sensor at the front door)
override:
  - binary_sensor.im_entrada

# This group is special and only effects 'perimeter mode'. If perimeter_mode is enabled then any sensor in this group will trigger the alarm immediately if arm perimeter is set. There is no delayed group for this mode (unless requested as a feature of course!)
